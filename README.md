# MCVS-docker-action

Mission Critical Vulnerability Scanner (MCVS) Docker Action is a custom
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that consists of the
following steps:

- YAML linting.
- Dockerfile linting.
- Determining image name and tag.
- Docker image building.
- Docker image linting.
- Detecting waste in the docker image.
- Code and docker image security scanning using Grype and Trivy.
- Logging in and pushing the image to GitHub packages.
