      One of the Dockle checks is the inspection of use of secrets in
      environment variables. Currently, there is a reported bug
      `goodwithtech/dockle/issues/250`, i.e. if a specific version of a package
      will be installed then an error will be thrown by Dockle, which is
      incorrect. To mitigate this one has to specify the packages that are
      applicable, e.g.: `libcrypto3,libssl3`.

      A token is required to allow the mcvs-docker-action to push the
      image that it has been built, to the packages repository of the GitHub
      repository where the action has been run.
